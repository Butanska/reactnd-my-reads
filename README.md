# BookShelf: A Book Tracking App

##### Book Shelf is a simple react project for [Udacity’s React Fundamentals course](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019).

# App Functionality

In this application, the main page displays a list of **"shelves"** (i.e. categories), each of which contains a number of books. The three shelves are:

- **Currently Reading**
- **Want to Read**
- **Read**


##### The main page also has a link to **_/search_** , a search page that allows you to find books to add to your library.



##### if you typed another link the app will redirect you to **error 404 page**



## To run the app you need to:

Since the project was set up with lockfileVersion@3, it is recommended to use Node.js 16.x (which comes with npm 7 or later) for better stability and support for the latest features.

Steps to Switch Node.js Version:
If you're using nvm (Node Version Manager), you can easily switch to a compatible version by running:

### 1. `nvm install 16.20.2` to install Node.js 16
### 2. `nvm use 16.20.2` to use Node.js 16

You can then proceed to open the project directory with cmd and run:

##### 1. `npm install` to install all project dependencies.

##### 2. `npm start` start the development server in http://localhost:3000/



# MyReads Project

This is the starter template for the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. The goal of this template is to save you time by providing a static example of the CSS and HTML markup that may be used, but without any of the React code that is needed to complete the project. If you choose to start with this template, your job will be to add interactivity to the app by refactoring the static code in this template.

Of course, you are free to start this project from scratch if you wish! Just be sure to use [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) to bootstrap the project.

## TL;DR

To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

    ├── index.css # Global styles. You probably won't need to change anything here.
    └── index.js # You should not need to modify this file. It is used for DOM rendering only.
```

Remember that good React design practice is to create new JS files for each component and use import/require statements to include them where they are needed.

## Backend Server

To simplify your development process, we've provided a backend server for you to develop against. The provided file [`BooksAPI.js`](src/BooksAPI.js) contains the methods you will need to perform necessary operations on the backend:

* [`getAll`](#getall)
* [`update`](#update)
* [`search`](#search)

### `getAll`

Method Signature:

```js
getAll()
```

* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of book objects.
* This collection represents the books currently in the bookshelves in your app.

### `update`

Method Signature:

```js
update(book, shelf)
```

* book: `<Object>` containing at minimum an `id` attribute
* shelf: `<String>` contains one of ["wantToRead", "currentlyReading", "read"]  
* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing the response data of the POST request

### `search`

Method Signature:

```js
search(query)
```

* query: `<String>`
* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of a maximum of 20 book objects.
* These books do not know which shelf they are on. They are raw results only. You'll need to make sure that books have the correct state while on the search page.

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
